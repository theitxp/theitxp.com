# Who We Are

What's up?! This is the home of the The IT XP, a show dedicated to the world of Information Technology
and the professionals working to drive business initiatives using their technology skills. Whether you are a 
developer or a systems administrator, if your using "The Cloud" or hosting on-premises, we're going to provide you 
with some nuggets of insight on what happens behind the curtain of an organization's IT department.

The term Information Technology is an umbrella term covering a wide array of technologies and job functions. You may not be working in
a formal IT department, but when we pull back the layers, most in your organization will call you IT; obviously this isn't a blanket 
statement, but one that identifies technology professionals outside of true technology firms. Let's be realistic, even the large tech
firms have an IT department. Hell, I bet your mom thinks you just fix computers. Meanwhile you're probably writing some of the best code
on Github!

Whether you are a helpdesk agent, developer, project manager, cybersec analyst, dba or any other title that puts you in the umbrella
of Information Technology, then this show is for you.

We pull back the curtain and expose some of the inner workings of what it's like to work in Information Technology.
